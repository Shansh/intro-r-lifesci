# Introduction to R and Bioconductor for Cell Biology 8401

## R basics

R as a glorified calculator. Try typing this in directly into the console. Then start typing this into the editor, and save your script. Use the run button, or press `CMD`+`Enter` (`Ctrl`+`Enter` on Windows).


```coffee
2 + 2
```

```
## [1] 4
```

```coffee
5 * 4
```

```
## [1] 20
```

```coffee
2^3
```

```
## [1] 8
```


R Knows order of operations


```coffee
2 + 3 * 4
```

```
## [1] 14
```


R has built-in functions


```coffee
sqrt(144)
```

```
## [1] 12
```

```coffee
log(1000)
```

```
## [1] 6.908
```


Get help by typing a question mark in front of the function's name:


```coffee
`?`(log)
```
