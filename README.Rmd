# Introduction to R and Bioconductor for Cell Biology 8401

## R basics

R as a glorified calculator. Try typing this in directly into the console. Then start typing this into the editor, and save your script. Use the run button, or press `CMD`+`Enter` (`Ctrl`+`Enter` on Windows).

```{r}
2+2
5*4
2^3
```

R Knows order of operations

```{r}
2+3*4
```

R has built-in functions

```{r}
sqrt(144)
log(1000)
```

Get help by typing a question mark in front of the function's name:

```{r}
?log
```
